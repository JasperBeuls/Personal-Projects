<h1>Permissions</h1>

<p>The Unix operating system (and likewise, Linux)
differs from other computing environments in that
it is not only a <i>multitasking</i> system but it
is also a <i>multi-user</i> system as well.</p>

<p>What exactly does this mean? It means that more
than one user can be operating the computer at the
same time. While your computer will only have one
keyboard and monitor, it can still be used by more
than one user. For example, if your computer is
attached to a network, or the Internet, remote
users can log in via <tt class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/telnet1.html">telnet</a></tt> or <tt class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/ssh1.html">ssh</a></tt> (secure shell)
and operate the computer. In fact, remote users can
execute X applications and have the graphical
output displayed on a remote computer. The X
Windows system supports this.</p>

<p>The multi-user capability of Unix is not a
recent "innovation," but rather a feature that is
deeply ingrained into the design of the operating
system. If you remember the environment in which
Unix was created, this makes perfect sense. Years
ago before computers were "personal," they were
large, expensive, and centralized. A typical
university computer system consisted of a large
mainframe computer located in some building on
campus and <i>terminals</i> were located throughout
the campus, each connected to the large central
computer. The computer would support many users at
the same time.</p>

<p>In order to make this practical, a method had to
be devised to protect the users from each other.
After all, you could not allow the actions of one
user to crash the computer, nor could you allow one
user to interfere with the files belonging to
another user.</p>

<p>This lesson will cover the following
commands:</p>

<ul>
	<li><tt class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/chmod1.html">chmod</a></tt> - modify
	file access rights</li>

	<li><tt class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/su1.html">su</a></tt> - temporarily
	become the superuser</li>

	<li><tt class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/chown1.html">chown</a></tt> - change
	file ownership</li>

	<li><tt class="user"><a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/chgrp1.html">chgrp</a></tt> - change a
	file's group ownership</li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="file_permissions">File
permissions</a></h2>

<p>Linux uses the same permissions scheme as Unix.
Each file and directory on your system is assigned
access rights for the owner of the file, the
members of a group of related users, and everybody
else. Rights can be assigned to read a file, to
write a file, and to execute a file (i.e., run the
file as a program).</p>

<p>To see the permission settings for a file, we
can use the <tt class="user">ls</tt> command as
follows:</p>

<div class="display">
<p><tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt> <tt class="cmd">ls -l some_file</tt></p>
<pre><tt class="prompt">
-rw-rw-r-- 1 me   me   1097374 Sep 26 18:48 some_file</tt>
</pre>
</div>

<p>We can determine a lot from examining the
results of this command:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The file "some_file" is owned by user
	"me"</li>

	<li>User "me" has the right to read and write
	this file</li>

	<li>The file is owned by the group "me"</li>

	<li>Members of the group "me" can also read and
	write this file</li>

	<li>Everybody else can read this file</li>
</ul>

<p>Let's try another example. We will look at the
<tt class="user">bash</tt> program which is located
in the <tt class="user">/bin</tt> directory:</p>

<div class="display">
<p><tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt> <tt class="cmd">ls -l /bin/bash</tt></p>
<pre><tt class="prompt">
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  316848 Feb 27  2000 /bin/bash</tt>
</pre>
</div>

<p>Here we can see:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The file "/bin/bash" is owned by user
	"root"</li>

	<li>The superuser has the right to read, write,
	and execute this file</li>

	<li>The file is owned by the group "root"</li>

	<li>Members of the group "root" can also read and
	execute this file</li>

	<li>Everybody else can read and execute this
	file</li>
</ul>

<p>In the diagram below, we see how the first
portion of the listing is interpreted. It consists
of a character indicating the file type, followed
by three sets of three characters that convey the
reading, writing and execution permission for the
owner, group, and everybody else.<br>
<br>

</p>

<h2><a name="chmod">chmod</a></h2>

<p>The <tt class="user">chmod</tt> command is used
to change the permissions of a file or directory.
To use it, you specify the desired permission
settings and the file or files that you wish to
modify. There are two ways to specify the
permissions, but I am only going to teach one
way.</p>

<p>It is easy to think of the permission settings
as a series of bits (which is how the computer
thinks about them). Here's how it works:</p>

<pre><tt>rwx rwx rwx = 111 111 111
rw- rw- rw- = 110 110 110
rwx --- --- = 111 000 000

and so on...

rwx = 111 in binary = 7
rw- = 110 in binary = 6
r-x = 101 in binary = 5
r-- = 100 in binary = 4
</tt>
</pre>

<p>Now, if you represent each of the three sets of
permissions (owner, group, and other) as a single
digit, you have a pretty convenient way of
expressing the possible permissions settings. For
example, if we wanted to set <tt>some_file</tt> to
have read and write permission for the owner, but
wanted to keep the file private from others, we
would:</p>

<div class="display">
<p><tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt> <tt class="cmd">chmod 600 some_file</tt></p>
</div>

<p>Here is a table of numbers that covers all the
common settings. The ones beginning with "7" are
used with programs (since they enable execution)
and the rest are for other kinds of files.<br>
<br>
</p>

<table cellpadding="8" border="">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td><em>Value</em></td>

		<td><em>Meaning</em></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
		<p><em>777</em></p>

		users.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>

		<p><em>700</em></p>
		</td>

		<td>
		<p><em>(rwx------)</em> The file's owner may

		</td>

		<td>
		<p><em>(rw-r--r--)</em> The owner may read

		files that everybody may read, but only the

		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
		<p><em>600</em></p>
		</td>

		<p><em>(rw-------)</em> The owner may read

		A common setting for data files that the
		owner wants to keep private.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

<h2><a name="directory_permissions">Directory
permissions</a></h2>

<p>The <tt class="user">chmod</tt> command can also
be used to control the access permissions for
directories. In most ways, the permissions scheme
for directories works the same way as they do with files.
However, the execution permission is used in a
different way. It provides control for access to
file listing and other things. Here are some useful
settings for directories:<br>
<br>
</p>

<table cellpadding="8" border="">
	<tbody><tr>
		<td><em>Value</em></td>

		<td><em>Meaning</em></td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
		<p><em>777</em></p>
		</td>

		<td>
		<p><em>(rwxrwxrwx)</em> No restrictions on
		permissions. Anybody may list files, create
		new files in the directory and delete files
		in the directory. Generally not a good
		setting.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
		<p><em>755</em></p>
		</td>

		<td>
		<p><em>(rwxr-xr-x)</em> The directory owner
		has full access. All others may list the
		directory, but cannot create files nor delete
		them. This setting is common for directories
		that you wish to share with other users.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

	<tr>
		<td>
		<p><em>700</em></p>
		</td>

		<td>
		<p><em>(rwx------)</em> The directory owner
		has full access. Nobody else has any rights.
		This setting is useful for directories that
		only the owner may use and must be kept
		private from others.</p>
		</td>
	</tr>

<h2><a name="su">Becoming the superuser for a short
while</a></h2>

<p>It is often useful to become the superuser to
perform important system administration tasks, but
as you have been warned (and not just by me!), you
should not stay logged on as the superuser.
In most distributions, there is a program that can give you
temporary access to the superuser's privileges.
This program is called <tt class="user">su</tt>
(short for substitute user) and can be used in those
cases when you need to be the superuser for a small
number of tasks. To become the superuser, simply
type the <tt class="user">su</tt> command. You will
be prompted for the superuser's password:</p>

<div class="display">
<p><tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt> <tt class="cmd">su</tt><br>
<tt class="prompt">Password:</tt><br>
<tt class="prompt">[root@linuxbox me]#</tt></p>
</div>

<p>After executing the <tt class="user">su</tt>
command, you have a new shell session as the
superuser. To exit the superuser session, type <tt class="user">exit</tt> and you will return to your
previous session.</p>

<p>In some distributions, most notably Ubuntu, an
alternate method is used.  Rather than using 
<tt class="user">su</tt>, these systems employ the 
<tt class="user">sudo</tt> command instead.  With 
<tt class="user">sudo</tt>, one or more users are 
granted superuser privileges on an as needed basis.  
To execute a command as the superuser, the desired 
command is simply preceeded with the
<tt class="user">sudo</tt> command.  After the command 
is entered, the user is prompted for the user's password 
rather than the superuser's:</p>

<div class="display">
<p><tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt> <tt class="cmd">sudo some_command</tt><br>
<tt class="prompt">Password:</tt><br>
<tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt></p>
</div>

<h2><a name="chown">Changing file
ownership</a></h2>

<p>You can change the owner of a file by using the
<tt class="user">chown</tt> command. Here's an
example: Suppose I wanted to change the owner of
<tt>some_file</tt> from "me" to "you". I could:</p>

<div class="display">
<p><tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt> <tt class="cmd">su</tt><br>
<tt class="prompt">Password:</tt><br>
<tt class="prompt">[root@linuxbox me]#</tt> <tt class="cmd">chown you some_file</tt><br>
<tt class="prompt">[root@linuxbox me]#</tt> <tt class="cmd">exit</tt><br>
<tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>Notice that in order to change the owner of a
file, you must be the superuser. To do this, our
example employed the <tt class="user">su</tt>
command, then we executed <tt class="user">chown</tt>, and finally we typed <tt class="user">exit</tt> to return to our previous
session.</p>

<p><tt class="user">chown</tt> works the same way
on directories as it does on files.</p>

<h2><a name="chgrp">Changing group
ownership</a></h2>

<p>The group ownership of a file or directory may
be changed with <tt class="user">chgrp</tt>. This
command is used like this:</p>

<div class="display">
<p><tt class="prompt">[me@linuxbox me]$</tt> <tt class="cmd">chgrp new_group some_file</tt><br>
</p>
</div>

<p>In the example above, we changed the group
ownership of <tt>some_file</tt> from its previous
group to "new_group". You must be the owner of the
file or directory to perform a <tt class="user">chgrp</tt>.</p>
